  <p> </p>
  <h2><em>Ingredients: </em> </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Eggs
      <ul>2 Table spoons </ul>
       </li>
    <li> Milk
      <ul>6 Tablespoons </ul>

  <h2><em>Recipe:</em></h2>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Add cream or milk (if desired). Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk until well blended. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>In a medium size skillet, add butter and melt over medium-high heat. (Watch so it doesn't scorch or burn.) Add eggs and let cook until edges are just starting to cook. With a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, fold edges of eggs toward center and gently stir. Repeat motion to continue to scramble the eggs until most are cooked and just parts appear loose or slightly runny.
    </li>
    <li>Remove eggs from heat, continuing to fold and stir to cook eggs a minute more. Slide eggs onto waiting plate and serve immediately.
